 *	Any number of commands can be added in a frame, from several different sources.
 *	Most commands come from either keybindings or console line input, but remote
 *	servers can also send across commands and entire text files can be execed.
 *
 *	The + command line options are also added to the command buffer.
 *
 *	The game starts with a Cbuf_AddText( "exec DEFAULT.CFG\n" ); Cbuf_Execute();
